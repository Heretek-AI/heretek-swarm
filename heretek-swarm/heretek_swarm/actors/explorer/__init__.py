Explorer Module - Intelligence Gathering Specialist

This module provides the ExplorerAgent for intelligence gathering,
opportunity discovery, and anomaly detection.

For backward compatibility, this module re-exports from the new package structure.
Import paths like `from heretek_swarm.actors.explorer import ExplorerAgent` continue to work.
