# Session Summary — 2026-06-28

Five Tier 1 slices shipped today. Each slice had an approved spec,
implementation plan, and a final review gate.

## Slices

### 1. LLM provider wiring (commit 7be68b06)
Replaced the `pydantic-ai` Agent layer with native `openai`/`anthropic`
SDKs in `tier1/llm/garage.py`. `ModelGarage._stream_from_provider` now
dispatches to provider-specific methods; `minimax`/`anthropic`/`openai`/
`local` are all wired. Settings adds per-provider model/key/URL fields.
**Tests:** `test_providers.py` (16 tests).

### 2. Tier 1 memory wiring (commits aa31d2e4 → f0916560)
`Tribunal` accepts an optional `memory: MemoryBackend | None` parameter.
`run_agent` in `_base.py` recalls up to 3 prior deliberations before
streaming and stores each verdict's reasoning after parsing. Both calls
are best-effort — failures are logged and swallowed so a memory
outage cannot break a deliberation.
**Tests:** `test_memory_wiring.py` (7 tests).

### 3. Cognee → Kùzu rewrite (commits 64560143 → 57022eb6)
Replaced the `cognee + NetworkX` implementation in
`tier1/memory/cognee_store.py` with raw Kùzu embedded graph + openai
SDK entity extraction. Public 5-stage surface preserved (`add`,
`cognify`, `search`, `improve`). Wired into `MemoryBackend.store()`
as an optional `cognee` parameter.
**Tests:** `test_cognee_pipeline.py`, `test_cognee_graph.py`,
`test_cognee_extraction.py` (17 tests).
**Final review fixes:** Schema PK, UUID type, iterator pattern, search
enrichment wired.

### 4. Observability test coverage (commits ada70721 → 9299f41e)
Pushed `tier1/observability/__init__.py` from 28% to 94% coverage
and `metrics.py` from 88% to 91%. One integration test verifies
spans flow from `get_tracer()` to `InMemorySpanExporter` without
needing a live Jaeger. Pollution fix added try/finally restoration
of OTel globals.
**Tests:** 7 new tests across `test_observability_init.py` and
`test_observability_metrics.py`.

### 5. Coverage scrub (commit be3e2e42)
Pushed `tier1/deliberation/graph.py` from 53% to 96% coverage and
`tier1/memory/__init__.py` from 49% to 93%. Tribunal.run() and
Tribunal.stream() now tested; MemoryBackend.store() tier branches
(qdrant/redis/postgres/mem0/cognee) covered.
**Tests:** `test_deliberation.py` (4 new), `test_memory_backend.py`
(+3 new).

## State at end of session

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Full suite (skipping `test_health.py`) | **186 passed, 11 skipped, 0 failed** |
| `deliberation/nodes/_base.py` coverage | 83% |
| `deliberation/graph.py` coverage | **96%** |
| `memory/__init__.py` coverage | **93%** |
| `memory/cognee_store.py` coverage | 86% |
| `observability/__init__.py` coverage | 94% |
| `observability/metrics.py` coverage | 91% |

## What didn't ship

Approved-but-unbuilt specs still untouched:
- `tier1-mem0-patterns-prefetch-design.md` — foundation code exists
  but is uncovered.
- `tier1-consensus-properties-design.md`
- `tier1-minimax-integration-tests-design.md`
- `agent-harness-landscape-design.md`
- `q4-conductor-approval-gate-design.md`
- `swarm-dashboard-overhaul-design.md`

The unbuilt Tier 2-6 swarm agents (in `backend/heretek_swarm/`)
remain the largest untouched scope.

## Push status

All work is committed locally to `main` in the `backend/tier1`
submodule. Manual push from the parent repo needed — the
`pre-dont-gates.sh` hook blocks submodule auto-pushes.

The first push (memory wiring + cognee + earlier slices) shipped
14 commits to `origin/main` (`c9e1df50..1cc1c875`). The
subsequent commits (coverage scrub + observability tests +
this session's other work) are local-only.
