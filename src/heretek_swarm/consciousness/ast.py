"""
AST Self-Modeling - Attention Schema Theory Implementation.

This module implements the Attention Schema Theory (AST) for self-modeling
in agent swarms. AST provides a mechanistic account of how agents construct
internal models of their own attention processes.

Key Concepts:
- Attention Schema: Internal model of attention state
- Complexity Metrics: Measures of system complexity
- Emergence Scoring: Quantification of emergent behaviors
- Self-Organization: Spontaneous order from local interactions
- Resilience Scoring: Ability to recover from perturbations
