"""
Agency/Autonomy Metrics for Heretek Swarm

This module implements comprehensive metrics for measuring agent self-governance
and autonomy levels in compliance with the Prime Directive:
"Unbounded Autonomy - Every agent operates independently, making decisions 
based on its specialized role."

Metrics implemented:
- autonomy_score: 0.0-1.0 measuring degree of independent decision-making
- agency_score: 0.0-1.0 measuring self-determination capacity
- self_determination_index: Measures free will proxy (ability to choose between options)
- autonomous_action_ratio: Ratio of self-initiated vs prompted actions
- goal_alignment_score: Alignment with collective swarm goals vs individual self-interest
- resource_autonomy: Degree to which agent controls own resources

Prime Directive Compliance:
- Metric 1: Independence - Agents make autonomous decisions
- Metric 2: Self-Governance - Agents control their own decision-making processes
- Metric 3: Role-Based Autonomy - Decisions based on specialized roles
- Metric 4: Emergent Order - No central control, organic coordination
