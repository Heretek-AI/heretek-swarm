"""heretek_swarm_api — Phase 4 of PLAN.md.

The FastAPI HTTP surface for the Heretek Swarm. Phase 4 of
the audit (§1.13) carves the api sub-packages out of the
single heretek-swarm package.

This package is the future home for:
  * api/ — FastAPI application + 22+ routers
  * observability/ (router portion) — alerting, db_timing,
    metrics, prometheus_metrics, timing
  * security/ (auth portion) — zero_trust middleware,
    adversarial detection, ddos_protection, etc.
  * mcp/, integrations/, plugins/
  * rag/ (orchestration-specific bits)
  * agents/ — agent registration HTTP

Today (2026-06-03), the canonical code still lives under
``backend/heretek_swarm/``. This ``__init__.py`` re-exports
the public surface from there so the new package is a
drop-in namespace.

The full migration is queued behind a multi-PR effort
(touches every router + middleware). The structural
foundation in this commit ships the namespace, the
pyproject.toml stub, and the re-export bridge.
