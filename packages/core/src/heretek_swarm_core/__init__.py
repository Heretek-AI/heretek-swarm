"""heretek_swarm_core — Phase 4 of PLAN.md.

The sovereign service library for the Heretek Swarm. Phase 4
of the audit (§1.13 'Sovereign multi-package monorepo')
carves the core sub-packages out of the single heretek-swarm
package.

This package is the future home for:
  * actors/, mixins/, base/
  * consensus/, gateway/, runtime/
  * memory/, llm/, embeddings/
  * models/, schemas/, swarm_logging/
  * config/ (lib portion), utils/, validation/, channels/

Today (2026-06-03), the canonical code still lives under
``backend/heretek_swarm/``. This ``__init__.py`` re-exports
the public surface from there so the new package is a
drop-in namespace for new code; activating the actual
build (which would require this package to own the source
files) is a multi-PR effort.

The migration plan is captured in the audit:
  1. Move the sub-packages from ``backend/heretek_swarm/``
     into this directory (``packages/core/src/heretek_swarm_core/``).
  2. Update internal imports to use the new namespace.
  3. Add heretek-swarm-core to heretek-swarm-api's deps.
  4. Activate the workspace member in the root
     ``pyproject.toml``.

Until then, this ``__init__.py`` is the bridge: new code
can write ``from heretek_swarm_core import …`` and the
import resolves through the re-exports below.

# PEP 562 lazy module attribute. ``ActorSupervisor`` triggers a cycle:
# actors.supervisor -> mixins -> collective -> consciousness ->
# fep_active_inference, which loops back through this __init__.py when
# ``heretek_swarm.security`` is imported during the cycle.
#
# Eagerly importing it here was previously masked because Task 3 left
# security/ under backend/heretek_swarm/ — moving consensus/ (Task 4)
# will surface the cycle on every `import heretek_swarm_core`. Resolving
# it lazily keeps the public surface stable while breaking the loop
# at module-load time. `from heretek_swarm_core import ActorSupervisor`
# still works; it just costs one extra dict lookup on first access.
