"""
Examiner Module - Quality Assurance & Testing Specialist.

This module provides the ExaminerAgent for quality assurance and testing.
The module has been refactored into separate components:

- types.py: Type definitions (TestType, TestStatus, QualityMetric, SeverityLevel, TestCase, TestSuite, Bug, QualityReport)
- testing.py: Testing mixins (ExaminingTestingMixin, ExaminingValidationMixin)
- agent.py: Main ExaminerAgent class

For backward compatibility, all public exports from the original examiner.py
are re-exported from this module.
