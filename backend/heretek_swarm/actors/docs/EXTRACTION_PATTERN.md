# Code Extraction Pattern for Oversized Actor Files

This document describes the extraction pattern established during the sentinel.py refactoring (M006-S03), providing a replicable process for reducing file sizes below 500 lines.

## Pattern Overview

The extraction pattern transforms monolithic actor files into modular packages by:
1. **Extracting type definitions** to `types.py`
2. **Extracting pure helper functions** to `helpers.py`
3. **Refactoring the main class** to inherit behavior from a `HelpersMixin`
4. **Maintaining backwards compatibility** via `__init__.py` re-exports

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Audit Structure

Before extracting anything, audit the source file to identify:

- **Top-level classes**: Main class and any mixins
- **Method counts**: Group methods by category (validation, reporting, utilities)
- **Imports**: Identify external dependencies and cross-module imports
- **Dependencies**: What other actors/modules does this file import from

**Audit checklist:**
```python
# Count lines of each section
- Class definitions
- Method definitions
- Import statements
- Docstrings
- Constants/Configuration
```

### Step 2: Identify Extraction Candidates

#### Types → `types.py`

Extract standalone types that don't depend on instance state:

- [x] **Enums** (StrEnum classes)
- [x] **Dataclasses** (immutable data containers)
- [x] **Type aliases** (complex type definitions)
- [ ] Nested classes that don't reference outer class state

**Example from sentinel.py:**
```python
# types.py
class SafetyLevel(StrEnum):
    SAFE = "safe"
    LOW_RISK = "low_risk"
    MEDIUM_RISK = "medium_risk"
    HIGH_RISK = "high_risk"
    CRITICAL = "critical"

@dataclass
class SafetyViolation:
    violation_id: str
    violation_type: ViolationType
    severity: SafetyLevel
    content_hash: str
    description: str
    timestamp: datetime
```

#### Pure Helpers → `helpers.py`

Extract methods that:
- [x] Don't require `self` state (or can work with passed parameters)
- [x] Are stateless or can operate on passed data
- [x] Are used by the main class but could be reused elsewhere
- [x] Have clear input/output contracts

**Pattern for helpers:**
```python
class SentinelHelpers:
    """Helper methods for Sentinel operations."""
    
    def __init__(self, *args: Any, **kwargs: Any) -> None:
        """Initialize and forward MRO chain (cooperative inheritance)."""
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
    
    def _helper_method(self, content: str) -> list[dict]:
        """Document the method purpose."""
        # Implementation
        pass

# Also provide standalone functions for independent use
def check_patterns(content: str, patterns: list[str] | None = None) -> list[dict]:
    """Standalone version for use without a class instance."""
    patterns = patterns or SentinelHelpers.DEFAULT_PATTERNS
    # Implementation
    pass
```

**Key pattern insight:** Use `super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)` for cooperative multiple inheritance.

### Step 3: Create Submodule Files

Create the following structure:

```
actor_name/
├── __init__.py       # Main exports with backwards compat
├── types.py          # Enums and dataclasses
├── helpers.py        # Helper methods and mixin
└── agent.py          # Main class (renamed from original)
```

**File creation order:**
1. `types.py` first (no dependencies on other modules)
2. `helpers.py` (depends on types.py)
3. `agent.py` (depends on types.py and helpers.py)
4. `__init__.py` (re-exports from all)

### Step 4: Update Imports in Main File

**Before (original sentinel.py):**
```python
from heretek_swarm.actors.sentinel import SentinelAgent, SafetyLevel
```

**After (sentinel/agent.py):**
```python
from heretek_swarm.actors.sentinel.helpers import SentinelHelpers
from heretek_swarm.actors.sentinel.types import (
    SafetyLevel,
    SafetyViolation,
    ViolationType,
)
```

**Main class inheritance:**
```python
class SentinelAgent(
    HealthReportingMixin,
    ValidationMixin,
    SentinelHelpers,  # Extracted mixin
    AgentActor,
):
    pass
```

### Step 5: Update `__init__.py` Re-exports

```python
# __init__.py
from heretek_swarm.actors.sentinel.agent import SentinelAgent
from heretek_swarm.actors.sentinel.types import (
    SafetyLevel,
    SafetyViolation,
    ViolationType,
)
from heretek_swarm.actors.sentinel.helpers import (
    SentinelHelpers,
    check_patterns,
)

__all__ = [
    "SentinelAgent",
    "SafetyLevel",
    "SafetyViolation", 
    "ViolationType",
    "SentinelHelpers",
    "check_patterns",
]
```

### Step 6: Verify Backwards Compatibility

**Old import paths must continue to work:**
```python
# These must all still work:
from heretek_swarm.actors.sentinel import SentinelAgent
from heretek_swarm.actors.sentinel import SafetyLevel, ViolationType
from heretek_swarm.actors.sentinel import SentinelHelpers
```

**Run regression tests:**
```bash
pytest tests/ -k sentinel
```

## Success Criteria

After extraction, each module should:
- [ ] Have each submodule under 500 lines
- [ ] Maintain all original functionality
- [ ] Pass all existing tests
- [ ] Provide backwards-compatible imports
- [ ] Have clear docstrings for each module
- [ ] Export types and helpers from `__init__.py`

## Key Decisions from sentinel.py Extraction

1. **Cooperative Inheritance**: The mixin's `__init__` must call `super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)` to work correctly in Python's MRO.

2. **Dual Interface**: Provide both a mixin class (for class integration) AND standalone functions (for independent use).

3. **Backwards Compatibility**: Always update `__init__.py` to re-export from the new locations, preserving old import paths.

4. **Type-First Extraction**: Extract types before helpers since helpers often depend on types.

5. **Instance State Access**: Helper methods that need instance state should reference `self._state` attributes, matching the pattern used in the original class.
