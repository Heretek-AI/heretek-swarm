"""
Type definitions for the immune-response engine.

The data classes and enums here are pure value objects used by
ImmuneResponseBuilding and ImmuneResponseEngine (in
immune_engine.py). They were extracted as part of Phase 2.11
of PLAN.md — the engine itself remains two large classes
(ImmuneResponseBuilding and ImmuneResponseEngine) but the
pure value-object surface is no longer interleaved with the
algorithm code.

The types module imports nothing from the engine. New code that
only needs the value objects (e.g. UI code that displays an
AnomalyResponse or an ImmuneQuorum) can import from
here to avoid the heavier transitive dependency on the engines.
