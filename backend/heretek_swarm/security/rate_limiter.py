"""
SlowAPI-backed rate limiting shim.

Replaces the bespoke ``RateLimiter`` token-bucket implementation in
``security/ddos_protection.py`` (Phase 1.5 of PLAN.md, §3.1 Replace).

Why
---
- The hand-rolled ``RateLimiter`` is 200+ LOC of sliding-window + token
  bucket math that is not exercised by tests in CI. Slowapi has the
  same algorithms implemented against the battle-tested ``limits``
  library (storage backends in-memory, Redis, Memcached).
- Slowapi plugs into FastAPI as middleware, which is the existing
  pattern in ``api/main.py``. The previous code-path was an
  in-process ``RateLimiter`` instance shared across requests, which is
  unsafe under multiple workers.

Scope
-----
- This module is the canonical entry point for new code. The legacy
  ``RateLimiter`` in ``ddos_protection.py`` is kept for backward
  compatibility (DDoS detection uses it) but new request-path
  rate limiting should call into this shim.
- DDoS-specific detection (request-spike, geo-anomaly, pattern
  detection) is **not** in scope for slowapi and stays in
  ``ddos_protection.py``. The two layers compose: this shim is the
  per-request gate; ``DDoSDetector`` is the pattern-level guard.

Usage
-----
>>> from heretek_swarm.security.rate_limiter import limiter
>>> from slowapi.util import get_remote_address
>>> @limiter.limit("100/minute")
... async def my_route(request: Request): ...

Or in middleware form (added to ``app.state.limiter`` in ``main.py``).
