Decision Audit Trail - Facade module for consensus audit system.

This module provides backwards-compatible access to the split audit system.
All types and the main class are re-exported from the split modules:

- audit_models: All dataclass definitions (AuditEvent, DecisionRecord, etc.)
- audit_trail:  ConsensusAuditTrail (recording/writing methods)
- audit_query:   AuditQueryMixin (querying/reading methods, composed into main class)

For new code, import directly from the split modules:
    from heretek_swarm.consensus.audit_models import AuditEvent, DecisionOutcome
    from heretek_swarm.consensus.audit_trail import ConsensusAuditTrail

Example:
    from heretek_swarm.consensus.audit import ConsensusAuditTrail

    audit = ConsensusAuditTrail()
    audit.record_decision(decision_id="deploy-001", ...)
    results = audit.query_decisions(min_confidence=0.8)
    data = audit.export_audit_data()
