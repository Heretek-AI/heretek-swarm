"""
Backwards-compat shim. The immune-response engine moved to
:mod:`heretek_swarm_core.security.immune` per Phase 2.11 of PLAN.md
(§1.12 — "4 consensus algorithms + immune" — immune is misfiled).

New code should import from ``heretek_swarm_core.security.immune``
directly. This module remains so existing
``from heretek_swarm.consensus.immune import …`` call sites
keep working unchanged.
