"""
Memory initializer — extracted from
``runtime/main_loop.py`` as part of Phase 2.6 of PLAN.md.

The :func:`initialize_memory` free function configures
the cognee reader + writer on the swarm instance. The
main_loop ``_initialize_memory`` method delegates here.

Backwards compatibility: the legacy method
``AutonomousSwarm._initialize_memory`` is preserved as a
thin delegate so existing call sites work unchanged.
