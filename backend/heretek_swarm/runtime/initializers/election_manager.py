"""
Election-manager initializer — extracted from
``runtime/main_loop.py`` as part of Phase 2.6 of PLAN.md.

The :func:`initialize_election_manager` free function wires
the ElectionManager instance. The main_loop
``_initialize_election_manager`` method delegates here.

Backwards compatibility: the legacy method
``AutonomousSwarm._initialize_election_manager`` is preserved
as a thin delegate so existing call sites work unchanged.
