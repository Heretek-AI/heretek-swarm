LangGraph node wrappers for the HeavySwarm 5-phase workflow.

M-arch PR #6 follow-up: replace the custom 1,363-LOC HeavySwarm
orchestrator with a LangGraph ``StateGraph``. This module
provides the 5 phase nodes (research, analysis, alternatives,
verification, decision) as standalone callables. They are wired
together by ``langgraph_workflow.py``.

Public contract (preserved from heavyswarm.py):
  * :class:`heretek_swarm.orchestration.heavyswarm.WorkflowPhase`
  * :class:`heretek_swarm.orchestration.heavyswarm.PhaseResult`
  * :class:`heretek_swarm.orchestration.heavyswarm.WorkflowResult`
  * :class:`heretek_swarm.orchestration.heavyswarm.HeavySwarmWorkflow`

The nodes accept and return a ``WorkflowState`` TypedDict that
matches the public dataclasses. HeavySwarmWorkflow's existing
instance methods (``_research_phase`` etc.) are wrapped by
``legacy_phase_node`` so the new graph can delegate to the
existing 1,363-LOC implementation without rewriting it.
