"""
Realtime service stub — Phase 5.3 of PLAN.md.

In-process skeleton for the future WebSocket fan-out
sidecar. The stub exposes the same shape the sidecar
would expose (broadcast_a2a, broadcast_dashboard,
broadcast_external_call) but delegates to the canonical
``ConnectionManager`` (Phase 3.4) so behavior matches
the in-process WebSocket router exactly.

The exit criterion for activating 5.3 is in
``docs/SOVEREIGN_SERVICES.md``: F-010 from
``PRIME_DIRECTIVE.md`` is fixed AND the sidecar handles
≥10k concurrent WebSocket clients without backpressure
on the api process.
